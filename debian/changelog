  * applications-panel: Rename to overview panel.
    It handles aspects of the overview and app-grid.
  * overview-panel: Sort template children alphabetically
  * overview-panel: Drop GTK version check.
    We can assume recent enough GTK nowadays
  * overview-panel: Use g_object_unref.
    Simpler than g_clear_pointer
  * utils: Move wallpaper setting here.
    We make it an async function so it can be reused in other panels.
  * utils: Move picture mode from/to bool conversion here
  * lockscreen-panel: Use new helper from utils
  * overview-panel: Allow to set background wallpaper.
    This makes it consistent with the lockscreen wallpaper and gives us an
    easy way to disable it.
  * overview: Reindent UI file.
    No other changes
  * treewide: Fixed signed vs unsigned comparisons
  * build: Enable -Ssign-compare
  * build: Drop -Wno-missing-field-initializers.
    We set -Wmissing-field-initializers couple of lines above
  * overview-panel: Ask for confirmation when resetting favorites.
    People take great care in setting these up, let's check before going
    back to the defaults.

  * ms-sound-row: Add .oga to the list of suffixes
    .oga is the recommended file extension by the sound theme spec.

  * osk-panel: Fix error message. We're looking at completer info here.

    This is useful for testing as we're not dependent on the OSK installed
    on the system.
  * tests: Force an unknown OSK.
    This ensures tests like listing the panels don't depend on schema
    or files from the OSK.

  * ci: Let ci-fairy figure out the target branch.
    It uses gitlab-ci's CI_MERGE_REQUEST_TARGET_BRANCH_NAME
  * ci: Update to latest ci-fairy
  * ci: Enable signed-off-by checks
  * ci: Let ci-fairy run without dependencies
  * plugin-list-box: Fix indent
  * topbar-panel: Add log domain.
    Fixes f012151 ("topbar-panel: Create a new empty top bar panel")
  * plugin-list-box: Fix log domain
  * lockscreen-panel: Drop scan.
    This is done by the plugin-list-box anyway
  * plugin-list-box: Don't crash when we fail to load the extension.
    Rather give a hint what went wrong
  * build: Require glib 2.76.
    Allows us to use g_string_free_and_steal()
  * osk: Move p-o-s specific code to separate function
  * osk: Use AdwSwitchRow. Same functionality, less code.
  * osk-panel: Allow text completer selection.
    If a recent enough p-o-s provides the necessary data the user can select
    the used completer. If no such data is provided by the OSK we at least
    show the currently selected completer.
  * packaging: Drop unused file
  * osk-panel: Better handle the default completer.
    The default completer is indicated via the empty string (''). Make sure
    we provide some meaningful information.
    We do that here (rather than via the OSK) as for the case of a user
    selection we can then drop the confusing default entry.
    At some point we will enforce minimal completers on the OSK side and
    then this entry will just not be shown anymore.
  * osk-panel: Update completer when combo row changes

  [ MoonlightWave-12 ]
  * util: Fix typo
  * osk-panel: Add horizontal and vertical size-settings for Squeekboard.
    This makes it easier to adjust the keyboard to a convenient size,
    or work around scaling-issues.

  [ Stefan Hansson ]
  * gmobile: Update to 0.2.1
  * panel-switcher: Make scrollable.
    This allows the switcher to be scrolled if the height of the program is
    too small to display all options, which can happen if a device like the
    Librem 5 is viewing the program in landscape mode. It might also help
    devices with shorter screen if users have chosen a large text font.
    Additionally, it facilitates adding more options to the list in the
    future.
  * doap: Fix name, shortname, shortdesc and a typo.
    This project is not called Phosh, so let's set it to the real name.
    Makes for a slightly less confusing experience when selecting project in
    GNOME Builder.
    Additionally, make the shortdesc something unique.
    And, finally, fix a typo in description (up -> app).

    `gtk_widget_action_set_enabled` only work on those actions.
  * plugin-list-box: Update movability after loading plugins.
    Otherwise move-up/down will be will be marked as possible in the popover
    for the first/last row until we move at least one row.
  * plugin-row: Remove duplicate logic.
    This duplicates the logic of `update_enabled_move_actions()`.
  * osk-panel: Hide HW keyboard detection by default.
    It's only supported with phosh-osk-stub
  * osk-panel: Allow to configure OSK layouts.

    With this, a favorite can be dropped on the

  * packaging: Require recent phoc.
    This is needed to make touch DnD work
  * applications: Disable favorite arrangement with too old GTK.
    The code to organize favorites needs DnD on touch. This was only fixed
    recently in phoc 0.34.0~beta1:

    and GTK 4.13.2:

  * l5-panel: Init temperatures.
    This ensures they don't contain garbage in case sensors_get_value()
    doesn't set them.
  * application: Don't use self for GApplication
    self refers to an object of type PhoshMobileSettingsApplication not
    GApplication. Adjust the variable names in functions that did this
    differently. This makes it obvious where casts are needed.
    While at that fix an overly long line by introducing a variable.
