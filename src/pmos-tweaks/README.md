# Phosh Mobile Settings postmarketOS Tweaks support

## Introduction

This optional feature implements support for the YAML definition format
implemented by the now deprecated [postmarketOS Tweaks application][1].

Since the original documentation is incomplete, this serves as an up-to-date
reference that also includes notable changes from the original. While this
implementation largely strives to be compatible with the original, some features
are no longer as useful due to Linux phones gaining broader adoption and regular
settings applications implementing them. As such, they have not been implemented

If you see any justification for re-adding these features, patches are welcome!
